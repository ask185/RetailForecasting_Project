"0","# while the STL decomposition helps us see the trend in the data, but this is not the right model to use in this case; STL decomposition is additive and can not work with the multiplicative data, but our data is not additive; it is in fact multiplicative. We would need to log-transform our data to do the STL decomposition: log(yt)=Log(TxSxR)"
