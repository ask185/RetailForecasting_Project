This is the retail Forecasting Project I developed for ETC5550 - Applied Forecasting.

- Developed the economic forecasts for the monthly turnover of the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and toiletry goods industry in New South Wales (NSW), 
employing advanced statistical techniques in R.
- Conducted a thorough preliminary analysis of the dataset, uncovering underlying trends, seasonality, and cyclic 
patterns, which were critical for the development of accurate forecast models. 
- Expertly applied Exponential Smoothing State Space Models (ETS) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving 
Average (ARIMA) models to generate forecasts, achieving an optimal balance between model complexity and 
predictive accuracy. 
- Performed rigorous back-testing, evaluating the performance of ETS and ARIMA models on training data and 
comparing it against out-of-sample test data to ensure the robustness and reliability of the forecasts. 
- Implemented a systematic model selection process, incorporating both accuracy metrics and business 
considerations, to identify and recommend the most suitable forecasting model, significantly enhancing the 
predictive accuracy and value of the forecasting exercise.
